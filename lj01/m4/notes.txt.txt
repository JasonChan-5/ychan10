query operators provide additional ways to locate data within the database
$eq - equal to
$neq - not equal
$gt - greater than
$gte - greater than or equal
$lt - less than
$lte - less than or equal
{<field>: { <operator>: <value>}}
$and - all specified query clauses
$or - at least one
$nor - fail to match both
$not - negates query requirement
$or $nor have similar syntax. {<operator> : [{statement1}, {statement2},...]}
$not {$not: {statement}}
$and is present in the query by default
should only use it when including the same operator more than once in a query
$expr {$expr: {<expression>}} allows use of aggregation expressions, variables, and conditionals
example: {"$expr" : {"$eq": ["$start station name", "$end station name"]}}
$push - add an element to an array or turns a field into an array field if not already an array
order matters when searching through array fields
$all will bypass the order
$size : int - limits the results to specifically that link
projections specify which fields are shown
1 includes the field, 0 excludes, do not use both except when excluding _id field
$elemMatch displays only the documents that match the given conditions
dot notation - dot separates sub documents, like file path using /
