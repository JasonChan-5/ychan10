K09 -- Introduction to Flask
2020-10-09

Q0) Similar to java (int x = int("9"))
Q1) maybe this is a file path? if so this would be the current directory
Q2) Prints to terminal/command prompt
Q3) Prints __name__, whatever it is
Q4) no, because hello_world isn't run in this code
Q5) java, dot operator 

__name__ wasn't print because hello_world was never executed

I am more confused than ever, is flask a server?
Why is it "lazy loading"?
