Questions:

What does print(f" ... ") do?
Where in karl's code does he choose randomly using the percentages?
In almost every code I see people setting the dictionary value to the percentage but never the occupation, why?
Reoccuring word weights? What does it do/significance?
Why do some people use from ____ import ____, why not just import the whole module?
Concerns:

His code will not work because he opens "occupations.csv", but the only other file in the same directory is occupations.csv.txt".

Comments:
I see that the 2 main ideas used were either the use of "weight" or the <= operator, I don't think i have seen both in the same file
I (Jason) should try to remember that random.choice is a thing and not stick to just random.randint for everything
